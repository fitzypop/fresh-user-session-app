# Fresh User Session App

My attempt at a web app.

## MVP

List of basic requirements:

- [ ] Login Page
- [ ] Redirect to "user's home page"
- [ ] Store user information (securly) client side
- [ ] Integrate With Fauna

### Usage

Start the project:

```sh
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
